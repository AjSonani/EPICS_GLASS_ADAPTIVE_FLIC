 The code in the repo is in JavaScript, which according to the official Flic Hub SDK documentation is the official language that the packages are written in and stored in the hub. So, to match those packages and be effective with a streamlined process, the team also wrote code in JavaScript. It is important to note that the code in the files is a very rudimentary and basic outline of the code, that would be into the Flic Hub.

 The image above depicts of a basic connection that was made from the server side to the client side. This was the first step in our process to ensure that we were using JavaScript in a correct manner, and that our code performs. After we had an initial code, I tried to make it more complex by adding certain parts to the code which would recreate the Flic functionality to move the device screen from left to right. 
 
 However, the adaptive devices team decided not to move forward with this code as it was too complex to implement the required functionalities that our project partner wants. After a much deliberated discussion with the adaptive devices team, the team believed that with the time constraint, and the complexity of the code, we should find another way to meet our partner's requirements.
